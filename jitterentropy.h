/**
 * Function pointer data structure to register an external thread handler
 * used for the timer-less mode of the Jitter RNG.
 *
 * The external caller provides these function pointers to handle the
 * management of the timer thread that is spawned by the Jitter RNG.
 *
 * @var jent_notime_init This function is intended to initialize the threading
 *	support. All data that is required by the threading code must be
 *	held in the data structure ctx. The Jitter RNG maintains the
 *	data structure and uses it for every invocation of the following calls.
 *
 * @var jent_notime_fini This function shall terminate the threading support.
 *	The function must dispose of all memory and resources used for the
 *	threading operation. It must also dispose of the ctx memory.
 *
 * @var jent_notime_start This function is called when the Jitter RNG wants
 *	to start a thread. Besides providing a pointer to the ctx
 *	allocated during initialization time, the Jitter RNG provides a
 *	pointer to the function the thread shall execute and the argument
 *	the function shall be invoked with. These two parameters have the
 *	same purpose as the trailing two parameters of pthread_create(3).
 *
 * @var jent_notime_stop This function is invoked by the Jitter RNG when the
 *	thread should be stopped. Note, the Jitter RNG intends to start/stop
 *	the thread frequently.
 *
 * An example implementation is found in the Jitter RNG itself with its
 * default thread handler of jent_notime_thread_builtin.
 *
 * If the caller wants to register its own thread handler, it must be done
 * with the API call jent_entropy_switch_notime_impl as the first
 * call to interact with the Jitter RNG, even before jent_entropy_init.
 * After jent_entropy_init is called, changing of the threading implementation
 * is not allowed.
