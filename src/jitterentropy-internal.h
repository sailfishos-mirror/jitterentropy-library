 *
 * This value implies that for the APT, only the bits specified by
 * JENT_APT_MASK are taken. This was suggested in a draft IG D.K resolution 22
 * provided by NIST, but further analysis
 * (https://www.untruth.org/~josh/sp80090b/CMUF%20EWG%20Draft%20IG%20D.K%20Comments%20D10.pdf)
 * suggests that this truncation / translation generally results in a health
 * test with both a higher false positive rate (because multiple raw symbols
 * map to the same symbol within the health test) and a lower statistical power
 * when the APT cutoff is selected based on the apparent truncated entropy
 * (i.e., truncation generally makes the test worse). NIST has since withdrawn
 * this draft and stated that they will not propose truncation prior to
 * health testing.
 * Because the general tendency of such truncation to make the health test
 * worse the default value is set such that no data is masked out and this
 * should only be changed if a hardware-specific analysis suggests that some
 * other mask setting is beneficial.
 * The mask is applied to a time stamp where the GCD is already divided out, and thus no
 * "non-moving" low-order bits are present.
